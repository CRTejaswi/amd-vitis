# Values for diff_tolerance are obtained experimentally. They are non-zero for streaming cases because
# number of lanes differs between reference model and uut. They are non-zero for ssr cases since uut and reference
# model split the lookup angle into differet sub-angles. Sincos lookup values of these sub-angles suffer from information
# loss due to rounding. Further, there is a rounding error from their multiplication.
