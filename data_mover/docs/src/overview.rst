Overview
------------

Vitis Data Mover Library is an open-sourced Vitis library of exchanging data between PL and AIE.

**Memory Access**

TBD

* **AXI Burst Read and Write**:
  Reading data from AXI master port, and emit to stream (of possibly different width).
  Padding and vectoring could be removed in reading and added in writing.

* **Low Initiation Interval Access to URAM Array**:
  URAMs are 72 bit fixed, and currently very large buffers needs extra registers and forwarding-paths to be read/written every cycle.
  By providing an API for this, users can focus on the function design and avoid mixing challenge of different level in the same code.
