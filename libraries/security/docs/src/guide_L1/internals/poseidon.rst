Overview
========

Poseidon is a hash algorithm work natively with GF(p) objects. 
Itâ€™s a cryptographic hash function designed to work with integrity proof systems like SNARKs, STARKs, etc.
You can find detailed parameters and cryptographic analysis in `POSEIDON: A New Hash Function for Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems<https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf>`_.

Implementation on FPGA
======================

* Templated design, support different full-rounds and partial-rounds implementation.
* Stream interface, for input message, round constant, MDS matrix and output digest.
* Works with GF(p) of which p is a 256 bits width prime number.
* Generate 256 bits digest result
