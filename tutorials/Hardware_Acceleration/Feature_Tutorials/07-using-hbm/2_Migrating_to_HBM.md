# Migrating to HBM

## Application Overview

This tutorial uses a simple example of vector addition with DDR based implementation. Ports `in1` and `in2` are reading from DDR banks 0 and 1, respectively, and port `out` is writing the results in DDR bank 2. The tutorial will walk through the necessary changes to the existing application to migrate to HBM.

### Using DDR

The kernel code is a simple vector addition with the following function signature.

```
void vadd(
  const unsigned int *in1, // Read-Only Vector 1
  const unsigned int *in2, // Read-Only Vector 2
  unsigned int *out,       // Output Result
  int dsize,                // Size in integer
  const unsigned int kernel_loop, // Running the same kernel operations kernel_loop times
  bool addRandom           // Address Pattern is random
  )
```

- in1 and in2: Inputs for streaming data from DDR over AXI interfaces.
- out: Output for streaming output results of vector addition writing in DDR over AXI interface.
- dsize: Sets the size of memory access from kernel ports accessing DDR.
- kernel_loop: Number of times the kernel operations are being called to keep the kernel busy accessing memory.
- addRandom: Enables random access if set to 1.

For more information on the kernel source code, refer to `<Project>/reference_files/kernel.cpp`.

The ports to DDR banks connectivity is established with the system port mapping option using the `--sp` switch. This switch allows the developer to map the kernel ports to specific global memory banks. For more information, refer to [Mapping Kernel Ports to Memory](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Mapping-Kernel-Ports-to-Memory) in the Vitis User Guide.

The contents of the example connectivity file, `DDR_connectivity.cfg` are shown in the following code. Makefile target will create this file automatically.

```bash
[connectivity]
sp=vadd_1.in1:DDR[0]
sp=vadd_1.in2:DDR[1]
sp=vadd_1.out:DDR[2]
```

The host code creates three buffers, one each in DDR0, DDR1, and DDR2. Refer to host code available in `<Project>/reference_files/host.cpp`. Each buffer connects to a single DDR bank with a capacity of 16 GB, which is higher than the buffer size used in this application. You should be able to migrate up to max 4 GB due to limitations on the Linux kernel.

The following code creates the three buffers of size vector_size_bytes.

```
134 : cl::Buffer(context,CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR | CL_MEM_READ_ONLY, vector_size_bytes, &source_in1[total_data_size]);
135 : cl::Buffer(context,CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR | CL_MEM_READ_ONLY, vector_size_bytes, &source_in2[total_data_size]);
136 : cl::Buffer(context,CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR | CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY, vector_size_bytes, &source_hw_results[total_data_size]);
```

```
140 : krnl_vector_add.setArg(1, buffer_in2[j]));
141 : krnl_vector_add.setArg(0, buffer_in1[j]));
142 : krnl_vector_add.setArg(2, buffer_output[j]));
```

For more information on the kernel source code, refer to  `<Project>/reference_files/host.cpp`.

### Run the Application Using DDR

Run the hardware application using DDR with a size of 600 MB, sequential address pattern, and enqueue the kernel one time. The host will migrate 600 MB to DDR0 (buffer_in1) and DDR1(buffer_in2) respectively. The kernel will perform the compute and store the results in DDR2, buffer_output.

Here is the makefile command to run ().

``` bash
#make ddr_addSeq_build  - executed already in first module.
make ddr_addSeq
```

The above run command essentially expands to the following.

``` bash
make run TARGET=hw memtype=DDR dsize=600 addrndm=0 krnl_loop=1 buildxclbin=0
```

- memtype: Sets memory as DDR or HBM.
- dsize: The amount of data migrated by the host to memory banks and accessed by the kernel ports, in1 and in2.
- kernel_loop: Sets the number of time the kernel loop repeats.
- buildxclbin=0: Will not generate the new xclbin.
- txSize: Set to 64 by default. It is the size of transactions issued by kernel port while accessing memory.

The preceding make command will create the build directory ```../build/DDR_Banks_d512_txSize64``` reflecting the memory type, data and transaction size.

The above commands to run the application on hardware show the following results:

```
*** Running hw mode ***  Use Command Line to run application!
cd ./../build/DDR_Banks_d512_txSize64 &&  ./host vadd_hw.xclbin 600 0 1 64;

The host is migrating 600 MB of data to both DDR0 and DDR1. The kernel accesses this data using `in1` and `in2` ports from DDR0 and DDR1, respectively. The vector addition is performed by the kernel, and the results are written to DDR2. These results from DDR2 are migrated back to the host. The next section goes over the steps required to migrate this DDR-based application to HBM.

>**TIP:** ```TARGET=hw_emu``` can also be used for running hardware emulation, but this will take significant time to run the application for a 600 MB size buffer.

## Migration to HBM

The host code and kernel code are agnostic to the memory type used, whether DDR is used or HBM, or even PLRAMs. The only change you will need to make here is to modify the connectivity file.

The Vitis flow makes it easy to switch memory connection using `-sp` switches, and in this case, you need to replace DDR with HBM. The capacity of each HBM bank is 256 MB. Since your application requires 600 MB of data to be added, you will need three HBM banks as contiguous memory. The Vitis flow enables this by grouping the memory as shown below in the connectivity file.

### Run Ppplication Using HBM

You will perform the following three experiments here.

1. Kernel ports, `in1` and `in2` read from two HBM PCs. Host sends 512 MB data to HBM.
2. Kernel port, `in1`, and `in2` read from two HBM PCs. The host sends more data than 512 MB. This configuration will result in an application error because you are accessing more than 512 MB.
3. Kernel ports, `in1` and `in2` share the same HBM PC.

The contents of the example connectivity file, `HBM_connectivity.cfg` are shown below. Makefile target will create this file automatically based on argument, banks.

```bash
[connectivity]
sp=vadd_1.in1:HBM[0:1]
sp=vadd_1.in2:HBM[2:3]
sp=vadd_1.out:HBM[4:5]
```

1. Run the following command to use the application with HBM memory of size 512 MB for `in1`, `in2`, and `out` ports.

    ``` bash
    #make hbm_addSeq_2Banks_build  - executed already in first module.
    make hbm_addSeq_2Banks
    ```

    The above command is equivalent of:

    ```
    make run TARGET=hw memtype=HBM banks=0_1 dsize=512 buildxclbin=0
    ```

    - dsize=512: Sets the data size to be accessed from HBM by kernel port in1 and in2.
    - banks=0_1: Creates the `HBM_connectivity.cfg` file with contents shown as above in appropriate builddir, ../build/HBM_2Banks_d512_txSize64.

    ```
    cd ./../build/HBM_addSeq_2Banks_d512_txSize64 &&  ./host vadd_hw.xclbin 512 0 1 64;

    Total Data of 512.000 Mbytes to be written to global memory from host

    The kernel is invoked 1 time and repeats itself one time

    Found Platform
    Platform Name: Xilinx
    DEVICE xilinx_u50_gen3x16_xdma_201920_3
    INFO: Reading vadd_hw.xclbin

    Throughput Achieved = 13.0511 GB/s
    TEST PASSED
    ```

2. If the host transfers data equivalent to more than 512MB, the application will have the following error.

    Run the following command

    ```
    make run TARGET=hw memtype=HBM banks=0_1 dsize=600
    ```

    The application run results into error as shown below.

    ```
    cd ./../build/HBM_addSeq_2Banks_d512_txSize64 &&  ./host vadd_hw.xclbin 600 0 1 64;

    Total Data of 600.000 Mbytes to be written to global memory from host

    ```

As expected, the application results in error because you are trying to create a 600 MB buffer in HBM[0:1]. XRT sees this as a contiguous memory of 256*2 = 512 MB, but the host exceeds this size limit, resulting in an application error.

The provided Makefile adds the flexibility of creating your custom connectivity file by either using the `banks` argument. Make target has functionality available in `mem_connectivity.mk` to create the memory connectivity file.

3. If the application does not require the full memory bank, the Vitis flow also provides the capability of sharing the memory banks across the ports. Here is one example of connectivity for sharing banks between ports `in1` and `in2`.

    ```bash
    [connectivity]
    sp=vadd_1.in1:HBM[0:1]
    sp=vadd_1.in2:HBM[1:2]
    sp=vadd_1.out:HBM[3:4]
    ```

The ports `in1` and `in2` and sharing bank 1 of HBM. So the application can create buffers for each kernel port with 384 MB as maximum size.

Run the following command to use the application with HBM memory of size 384 MB for `in1`, `in2`, and `out` ports.

``` bash
#make hbm_addSeq_overlap_build  - executed already in first module.
make hbm_addSeq_overlap
```

The above command shows the following results.

```
*** Running hw mode ***  Use Command Line to run application!
cd ./../build/HBM_overlapBanks_d512_txSize64 &&  ./host vadd_hw.xclbin 384 0 1 64;

```

When multiple ports are sharing overlapping bank and one (or more) of the buffer trying to utilize the overlapping portion, the order of assigning buffers (in the host code) to the corresponding kernel ports can become important. In this particular example, both buffers for the ports `in1` and  `in2` are trying to utilize the overlapping bank 1 when each of them allocating 384 MB. Hence, the host application must assign buffer for `in1` first, and then assigns buffer for `in2`. Reversing this sequence will result into the `bad alloc` error. This is demonstrated in the following figure.

![Buffer Assignment for overlapping banks ](./images/Buffer_allocation.png)

In other words, there is no Lazy Allocation. The buffers are allocated upfront (and immediately) following the host code buffer handling order.

Additionally, you can also connect all the 32 HBM banks to each of the kernel ports based on the application requirement. This way, the whole memory space will be available to all the ports. The overall HBM efficiency will vary based on the access pattern and how many channels are being accessed, as described in the previous tutorial module.

## Next Step

In the next steps, you will experiment with how to achieve the maximum bandwidth using all 32 channels as connectivity but accessing either one PC or a group of PCs from a single kernel port and varying the address patterns as transaction size.
